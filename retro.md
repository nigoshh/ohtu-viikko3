The "Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel" retrospective plan starts with drawing a circle on a poster, and dividing it into 5 sections (the names of the sections are in the plan's name, so "start", "stop" and so on). Then each category is discussed, encouraging comments, which are then recorded into the respective section of the wheel. For example, the "start" category includes comments about things that the team should start doing in the next iteration.

The "Glad, Sad, Mad" retrospective plan starts with each participant writing brief notes about observations they have made. Then each participant puts the notes onto a board divided into three categories (glad, sad and mad), and briefly explains each note. Then one persons groups the notes together (possibly some notes cover the same topic). Then the participants vote on which issues the want to discuss. The issues are then discussed in descending order (by votes), until the time is up, or all issues have been discussed. The "sad" and "mad" categories are both negative, but the distinction is important because "mad" includes also issues that don't depend directly from the team.
